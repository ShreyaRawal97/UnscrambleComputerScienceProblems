# UnscrambleComputerScienceProblems

Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms nanodegree project 1.

Note that similar questions are still used in the class and the purpose of this repository is to showcase my programming experience, and not for others to look up the solutions. I will not be responsible for academic integrity issues should anyone else re-use any part of this code for their own assignments.
